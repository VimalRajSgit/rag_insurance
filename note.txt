The Problem You Identified
Scenario 1: Poor Row Retrieved

User asks: "What's a good deductible amount?"

Scenario 2: No "Best Practices" Data

User asks: "What's the best auto insurance coverage?"

4. Hybrid Approach

Retrieved data + LLM's general insurance knowledge
Frame answers as: "Based on this claims data... but generally recommended...
